Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


________________________Last year I did programing for HTML and Java I think. It was good exept that I would often get stuck on my program for having misspeled something once in the code and bieng stuck for that reason over and over again is extreamly anoying but what I love about programing is how it actualy works and seeing the program finished is what I realy like about coading. I love learning about how puting something in code afects the out put and using it in my own code or project




10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


___________This year I have learned about abstraction and about how VR works. One other thing that I learned was how to publish things on youtube wich will be very helpfull for future projects. In block 1 I think that we worked on Java and I was reminded about difrent parts of java and I learned some more parts of java to build on.




What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


____I would like to learn more about how to do difrent things in programing and to see how they work. I also would like to get better at typing and more consistand but learning how do do difrent parts of programing and how they work is by far way more intresting to me and better for me to learn.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


___I think that the think that chalenges me more than others in programing is my spelling, my typing speed, and my typing 


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


___My goal for computer programing is to learn more about it and it is posable that I could learn enough about it to be able to make a butiness that has sofwear included in it like an app or something else like that. I have tryed to create a ton of difrent business and I have failed a ton but I have leared a ton more. I am also trying to go pro in tennis and business is used a ton in image and in people who are pro's in tennis and investing your monney but also so much more.__________________________________________________________________________________
